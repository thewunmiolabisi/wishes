            <p>

With every sunrise and sunset too,<br>
My love for you continues to renew.<br>
In every whisper, in every sigh,<br>
I find myself lost in your sky.<br><br>

Your kindness, like a gentle stream,<br>
Flows through my soul, a cherished dream.<br>
In your arms, I find my rest,<br>
Where love blooms in its very best.<br><br>

this day, I celebrate you,<br>
Let's toast to love, greatness.<br>
Happy birthday, my guiding light,<br>
Together, we'll conquer every height.<br><br>

May this birthday be filled with delight,<br>
Happy birthday, My Biggest Fan!<br>
